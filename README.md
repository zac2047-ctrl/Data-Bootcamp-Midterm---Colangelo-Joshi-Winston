# Data-Bootcamp-Midterm---Colangelo-Joshi-Winston
In this project, we set out to decide whether or not the video game market was better for consumers who were more willing to spend more money on games compared to those who were willing to spend less money. Throughout our exploration of the data we scraped, we learned that while the average user experience is better for those willing to spend more money on games, there is no real qualitative reason why this would be true. Through this, we discovered that consumers see more expensive games as better, which is explained by the price-quality heuristic bias. We then used this to explain the trend of game costs in recent years.
